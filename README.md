<p>My name is <b>Carolina</b> and I am currently finishing my bachelor degree on <i>Games and Multimedia</i>. I discovered my passion for video games at a young age, which influenced me into pursuing game development as a profession.</p>
<p>I've developed 2D games on Unity using c# and 3D games on Unreal Engine using both blueprints and c++. I'm currently looking further to learn more about c++ and start learning other programing languagues.</p>
